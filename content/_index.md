    "disclaimer": "**Please note:** This sample ballot is not comprehensive. It does not include races for Common Pleas or magisterial district judges nor does it include any municipal races for mayor, school board, and other contests. This information is not maintained in a centralized way, meaning Spotlight PA must reach out to all 67 counties to obtain it. Spotlight PA is working to update its sample ballot with more information. We recommend reaching out to your <a href=\"https://www.vote.pa.gov/resources/pages/contact-your-election-officials.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">county election office</a> for more information."
